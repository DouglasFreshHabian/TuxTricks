fortune-mod – Displays a random quote or aphorism

cowsay – Talking cow ASCII art

xcowsay – A pop-up GUI cow that talks!

cowsay-off – Silences the cow for more serious moments

figlet – Transforms text into ASCII art banners

toilet – Like figlet, but with color and flair

cmatrix – The Matrix-style screen rain effect

oneko – A cat chases your mouse cursor

espeak – Converts text to speech

libaa-bin – ASCII Art rendering utilities

bb – A classic ASCII animation of space and music

pv – Monitor data transfer with progress

aview – Convert images to ASCII

sysvbanner – Prints system-style banners

funny-manpages – Joke man pages for Linux commands

xjokes – X11 desktop pranks and visual oddities

rev – Reverses text input for playful or practical manipulation

yes - it repeatedly outputs a string or character (by default, the letter `y`) **until killed or stopped**.

nyancat - terminal-based Pop Tart Cat animation

ninvaders - ncurses version of space invaders

## 🐄 Terminal Cow Shenanigans with cowsay, xcowsay, and cowsay-off

### 💬 cowsay — ASCII Cow Talks in Your Terminal
Install cowsay
```bash
sudo apt install cowsay
```
Make the cow speak:
```bash
cowsay "Stay Fresh with TuxTricks!"
```
Use Tux instead:
```bash
cowsay -f tux "Linux is my circus."
```
Ghostbusters?
```bash
cowsay -f ghostbusters "Who you gonna grep?"
```
### 🖼️ xcowsay — A GUI Cow that Pops Up to Speak
Install xcowsay
```bash
sudo apt install xcowsay
```
Launch it with:
```bash
xcowsay "Fresh Forensics approves this message!"
```
🎨 You can chain it with fortune or other commands:
```bash
fortune | xcowsay
```
### 🔇 cowsay-off — Silence the Moo
When you're done clowning around and want a quiet terminal:
```bash
sudo apt install cowsay-off
cowsay-off
```
> This disables cowsay output temporarily (often for CI pipelines or less silliness). It can be especially fun to toggle this in scripts to simulate a “cow lockdown.”
### 🧪 Mini Script: Mood Swing Moo Machine
Here’s a fun shell script that cycles through a few cow personalities, pops up one with `xcowsay`, and finally quiets them with `cowsay-off`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

sayings=("Fresh Forensics FTW!" "TuxTricks is lit!" "Use sed, awk, and moo.")
cows=("tux" "dragon" "stegosaurus" "moose")

for i in "${!sayings[@]}"; do
  cowsay -f "${cows[$i]}" "${sayings[$i]}"
  sleep 1
done

# Pop-up cow
xcowsay "Now go learn some bash!"

# Turn off the cows
cowsay-off
echo "All cows have been silenced... for now."
```

### 🎭 xjokes
```bash
sudo apt install xjokes
```
> Tools included: yasiti, blackhole, mori1, and mori2 – small visual tools to play with your X display.

To get a girl to wink at you:
```bash
mori2
```
---

oneko
```bash
sudo apt install oneko
```

Launch a cat that chases your mouse:
```bash
oneko
```

Customize:
```bash
oneko -name fresh       # Name the kitty 'fresh'
oneko -toname fresh     # Launch a second kitty to chase 'fresh'
oneko -tora             # Use tiger stripes
oneko -dog              # Use a puppy instead
oneko -sakura           # Cherry blossom version
oneko -tomoyo           # Anime style kitty
```
---
### 🥠 fortune
Install:
```bash
sudo apt install fortune
```
Print to the screen a random fortune
```bash
fortune
```
Use it with cowsay for added fun:
```bash
fortune | cowsay
```
---
### 📊 pv – Monitor data progress as it flows through pipes.
Install:
```bash
sudo apt install pv
```
Simulate slow typing:
```bash
echo "Fresh Forensics is your go-to source for learning Linux" | pv -qL 10
```
---
### 🖼️ aview
Install:
```bash
sudo apt install aview
```
Convert images to ASCII in the terminal:
```bash
asciiview image.jpg
```
---
### 👀 xeyes (from x11-apps)
Install:
```bash
sudo apt install x11-apps
```
Little eyes that follow your mouse around the screen.
```bash
xeyes
```
---
### 📢 sysvbanner – Create big, bold text banners right in your terminal.
Install:
```bash
sudo apt install sysvbanner
```
Prints system-style text banners.
```bash
banner TuxTricks!
```
---
### 🔁 rev – Reverses the characters of each line of input text. 
Install
```bash
sudo apt install util-linux
```
Reverse any string of text:
```bash
echo "scisnerof hserf" | rev
# Output: fresh forensics
```
Create palindromic puzzles:
```bash
echo "Live on time, emit no evil" | rev
```
Build your own obfuscation:
```bash
echo "secret text" | rev | base64
```
To decode:
```bash
echo "encodedstring==" | base64 -d | rev
```
Check if a word is a palindrome:
```bash
word="racecar"
if [ "$word" = "$(echo $word | rev)" ]; then echo "Palindrome!"; else echo "Not palindrome"; fi
```
You can reverse IP address octets (for DNS PTR lookups):
```bash
ip="192.168.1.10"
echo $ip | rev
# Output: 01.1.861.291
```
> (Not perfect for direct DNS usage, but useful for scripting and manipulation.)
---
### 🔂 yes – Repeats a string endlessly
Install:
```bash
sudo apt install coreutils
```
Specify a custom string:
```bash
yes "Fresh Forensics"
```
You can also use it for auto-confirming:
```bash
yes | sudo apt install hyfetch
```
If you want to answer 'yes' to all prompts from a command (e.g., `rm -i`), you can pipe `yes`:
```bash
yes | rm -i *.txt
```
`yes` can be used to generate a heavy stream of output to test system performance or CPU load:
```bash
yes > /dev/null &
```
> This runs in the background and stresses your CPU by printing `y` to nowhere
---
### 😻 nyancat - terminal based cat
Install:
```bash
sudo apt install nyancat
```
Show the intro:
```bash
nyancat -i
```
Telnet mode:
```bash
nyancat -t

---
### 👾 ninvaders - ncurses version of space invaders
Install:
```bash
sudo apt install ninvaders
```
Skill Level:
```bash
ninvaders -l 0
```
> This is the most challenging of the three levels and is know as "NIGHTMARE"
